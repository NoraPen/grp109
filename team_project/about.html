            <h2>Our Inspiration</h2>
            <p>Beau's Seattle Pet Rescue was inspired by a remarkable dog named Beau, Margaret K.'s dog. Beau is a dog whose resilient spirit and unwavering love touched the hearts of everyone he met. </p>
            <p>The project is aimed at helping volunteers sign up at a local charity that helps animals. The intended audience is potential volunteers who are interested in supporting animal welfare.</p>
            <p> Seattle animal rescue looks forward to no longer dealing with being inundated by all the local Seattle volunteers wanting to donate time to Beau's Seattle Pet Rescue. Charity wants to have a simple form consisting of labels, textboxes, dropdowns, validation and a submission button. This is really going to streamline the charity organization's workflow process and free up time for the animal's care.</p>

            <h2>Why We Matter</h2>
            <p>In today's rapidly growing Seattle metropolitan area, the need for dedicated animal welfare organizations has never been more critical. Here's why our work matters:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Over 6.3 million companion animals enter U.S. shelters each year</li>
                <li>Seattle's housing crisis has led to an increase in pet surrenders</li>
                <li>Many shelters are operating at maximum capacity</li>
                <li>The pandemic has created new challenges for pet owners</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Through our network of dedicated volunteers and foster families, we're making a real difference in our community. Every animal saved represents a life transformed and a family completed.</p>
